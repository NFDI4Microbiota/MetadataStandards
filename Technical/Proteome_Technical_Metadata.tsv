proteomics	Sample processing protocol	Short description of sample preparation including extraction, separation, enrichment, clean-up, digestion and mass spectrometry protocols	e.g. 200x106 B6-CIITA-Ed cells were either mock infected or PR8-infected in suspension in 0.1% BSA/PBS for 1 hr and incubated at 37  C, 6% CO2 for ~18 hr. Cells were harvested with PBS containing 2 mM EDTA. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of peptide/MHC-II complexes were carried out largely as previously described55, and all chemicals used after cell harvest were analytical grade or equivalent when available. Following lysis, all steps were conducted in Protein LoBind tubes from Eppendorf or glass Econo-Columns (Bio-Rad 7371012). Briefly, anti-MHC-II antibody (clone M5/114.5, BioXCell) was cross-linked to Protein G Sepharose beads (GE 17061801). Lysates and beads were co-incubated and rotated overnight at 4  C. After washing, peptide/MHC-II complexes were eluted in 10% acetic acid, and the collected material was lyophilized. After immunoprecipitation, purified peptide/MHC complexes were dissolved in 120  l loading buffer (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 1% acetonitrile (ACN) in water). Using an Ultimate 300 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher), samples were loaded onto a 4.6 x 50-mm ProSwift RP-1S (Thermo Fisher) monolith column, and peptides were eluted by applying a 10 min linear gradient from 3% to 30% ACN in 0.1% TFA at a flow rate of 500 nl/min. Fractions were collected in 1-minute intervals. Alternate fractions (odd and even) were combined in two final fractions, dried, resuspended in 20 ul of loading buffer, and analyzed by LC-MS2. Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS2 using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano System supplemented with a PepMap C18 column (2  m particle size, 75  m   50 cm, Thermo Fisher) directly interphased with an Orbitrap Fusion  Lumos  Tribrid  Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). A 60 min linear gradient from 3% to 25% ACN in 5% DMSO/0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nl/min was applied for peptide elution. Peptide ions were introduced to the mass spectrometer using an Easy-Spray Source at 2000 V. Detection was performed with a resolution of 120,000 for full MS (300-1500 m/z scan range), and precursors were selected using TopSpeed ion selection within a 2 second cycle time, and a quadrupole isolation width of 1.2 amu for fragmentation. For MS2 acquisition, the resolution was set at 30,000 and high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) energy was set at 28 for peptides with 2 to 4 charges and 32 for peptides that were singly charged.

proteomics	Data processing protocol	Short description of bioinformatics pipeline, software tools including versions, main search parameters and quantitative analysis	LC-MS2 datasets were analyzed using PEAKS v10.6 with the following parameters: precursor mass tolerance: 5 ppm; fragment mass tolerance: 0.05 Da; digestion: none; fixed modifications: none. The search database included the full reference sequences of the pDZ PR8 gene segments translated in all six reading frames (positive and negative sense), irrespective of start and stop codons, concatenated with the canonical PR8 viral proteome, and the reviewed mouse entries in Uniprot (Swissprot version 17 July 2019). For immunopeptidomics data, a threshold of -10lgP=20 was applied across all datasets, resulting in an estimate false discovery rate of ~1%.
